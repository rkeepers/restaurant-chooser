# restaurant-chooser
#
# So... do you and your partner ever get tired of deciding 
# where you want to go to lunch? I mean, we all make enough
# decisions everyday. Time to let the machine make up our mind.
#
# This is a simple python program to choose a random restaurant
# from a list kept in a text file called restaurantData.dat
# I have some ambitions of adding bias to the selection which
# is what the extra fields in the dat file are/will be for.
# But for now this does the job. Hey, it's like midnight
# cut me some slack.
